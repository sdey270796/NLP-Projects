He has been criticised by the SNP for encouraging young people to get drunk. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were \\\"a recognition that people will get drunk\\\". The first minister's comments came in a question and answer session at Glenurquhart High School in Inverness, attended by pupils from a number of secondary schools. A Highland councillor who was at the event has also defended Mr McConnell. Margaret Davidson, the independent member for the Loch Ness West, said the first minister was speaking in a very general way and she was sure he was speaking about adults at the time.\\n\\nWhen one pupil asked Mr McConnell how the executive proposed to tackle under-age drinking, began his response with the quip: \\\"I'm sure there's no under-age drinking in the Highlands.\\\" He went on to speak about the evils of binge drinking and railed against irresponsible drinks promotions. He said: \\\"I hope I'm not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people's health and their ability to control what's happening round about them.\\\" Mr McConnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes, and on the health consequences of binge drinking. \\\"The one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that,\\\" he said. \\\"Far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly. \\\"We are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening.\\\"\\n\\nHe added: \\\"By all means get drunk once in a while - but do not get into a situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly.\\\" SNP Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon said: \\\"This is an incredible gaffe by Jack McConnell. \\\"We all know that under-age drinking is an issue in Scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician, particularly the First Minister, should encourage young people to get drunk. \\\"The first minister should withdraw these remarks immediately.\\\" But an executive spokeswoman insisted Mr McConnell had made the remark with adults, not youngsters, in mind. \\\"He was talking in the context of adults binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions - which are for the over-18s,\\\" she said. \\\"It was just a recognition that people will get drunk, but that binge drinking and drinks promotions that encourage it are not acceptable.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Goldsmith denies war advice claim\\n\\nThe attorney general has denied his statement to Parliament about the legality of the Iraq war was drafted by Downing Street officials.\\n\\nLord Goldsmith said Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan played no part in drafting the answer. He added the answer represented his view that the war was legal, but was not a summary of his advice to the PM. The government has resisted calls to publish the full advice, saying such papers are always kept confidential.\\n\\nIn a statement, Lord Goldsmith said: \\\"I was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised, and of course approved, the answer.\\\" He said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of Solicitor General Harriet Harman, two of his own officials, three Foreign Office officials, a QC, Christopher Greenwood and the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg.\\n\\n\\\"No other minister or official was involved in any way.\\\" He suggested the claim that Lord Falconer and Lady Morgan had drafted the answer were the result of a mis-transcription of his evidence to the Butler Inquiry into pre-war intelligence. \\\"As I have always made clear, I set out in the answer my own genuinely held, independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (UN) Security Council resolutions,\\\" he said. \\\"The answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government.\\\" Former foreign secretary Robin Cook said Lord Goldsmith's admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested Parliament may have been misled. \\\"The attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary, but others certainly did,\\\" he said. \\\"What is clear from his statement today is that he does not believe that it was a full, accurate summary of his formal opinion.\\\"\\n\\nEarlier, Tony Blair dismissed questions about the attorney general's advice, and said his Parliamentary statement had been a \\\"fair summary\\\" of his opinion. \\\"That's what he (Lord Goldsmith) said and that's what I say. He has dealt with this time and time and time again,\\\" Mr Blair told his monthly news conference in Downing Street. He refused to answer further questions on the issue.\\n\\nOn the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential, Tory MP Michael Mates, who is a member of the Commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the Butler inquiry, told the BBC: \\\"That, as a general rule, is right, but it's not an absolute rule.\\\" He said there had been other occasions when advice had been published, most recently regarding Prince Charles's marriage plans. The government could not pick and choose when to use the convention, he said. Mr Mates added: \\\"This may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.\\\"\\n\\nThe claims about Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan's involvement were made in a book published this week by Philippe Sands QC, a member of Cherie Blair's Matrix Chambers. He also says Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair on 7 March 2003 that the Iraq war could be illegal without a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.\\n\\nA short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this. Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. She said the full advice should have been attached, according to the ministerial code, and demanded a Lords inquiry into the matter. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they still want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General. Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said Lord Goldsmith's statement still did not clear up the outstanding issues. \\\"If his original advice of 7 March accepted that military action might be illegal, how was it that he resolved any such doubts by the time the Parliamentary answer was published on 17 March?\\\" he said. \\\"Only the fullest disclosure will now do.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Iraq advice claim sparks new row\\n\\nThe Tories say ministers must respond in Parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the Iraq war was drawn up at Number 10.\\n\\nDowning Street has denied the claims, made in a new book about the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith's advice. Lord Goldsmith also denied them, saying he was not \\\"leaned on\\\" in any way. But the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General.\\n\\nThe government has consistently refused to publish Lord Goldsmith's advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.\\n\\nBut a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action. It said it was \\\"plain\\\" Iraq continued to be in material breach of UN resolution 1441. In his new book, Lawless World, Philippe Sands, a QC and international law professor, suggests the parliamentary answer was written in Downing Street. According to Mr Sands, Lord Goldsmith had warned Tony Blair in a document on 7 March 2003 that the use of force against Iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.\\n\\nMr Sands told Newsnight the government had prepared a legal team to be able to defend its case, in case legal action was taken against the UK over the war. On 10 March, military chiefs reportedly asked for an unequivocal statement about the legality of the war to make sure troops could be defended in a court of law. The book, being serialised in the Guardian newspaper, says on 13 March Lord Goldsmith met then Home Office Minister Lord Falconer and Downing Street adviser Baroness Morgan. \\\"After that Downing Street proceeded to set out his [Lord Goldsmith's] view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on 17 March,\\\" said Mr Sands.\\n\\nTory leader Michael Howard reiterated calls for the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General, warning: \\\"This issue will not go away.\\\" \\\"These revelations throw an intensive spotlight on to the cavalier way in which this government operates - even on an issue as important as peace and war. \\\"The government needs to act to restore public confidence and trust.\\\" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell repeated his party's calls for Lord Goldsmith's first piece of legal advice to be made public. \\\"The public interest, which the government claims justifies non-publication of the whole of the advice, can only be served now by the fullest disclosure.\\\"\\n\\nIn a statement to Newsnight, Lord Goldsmith said: \\\"In my parliamentary answer on March 17 2003, I explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing Security Council resolutions. \\\"It was certainly not a view that I expressed as a result of being leaned on in any way, nor as I have already made clear, was it written by or at Number 10.\\\" The prime minister's official spokesman also rejected the claims, saying: \\\"The attorney general made it clear the words and the judgement were his.\\\" But ex-foreign secretary Robin Cook says all the advice should now be published. He said the claims suggested Parliament had only received a pr&#233;cis of Lord Goldsmith's second opinion - and that it was actually drafted in No 10. This would be wrong even if Lord Goldsmith had signed the statement, Mr Cook said, because the attorney general's advice should be an \\\"independent legal opinion\\\", not subject to \\\"political negotiation of this kind\\\".\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]}]}
